## Introduction
A feature rich economy plugin, aimed at providing support for multiple integrations and an easy to use API. A key feature is our web hook support which provides a centralised place to store the information to be accessed by other services (e.g. a microservice). This allows for offline access to player information, also allowing for more separate features to be created in conjunction with a website.
